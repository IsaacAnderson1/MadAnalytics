## About The Project

This project was developed in collaboration with **Cub Foods** and **Crystal Farms Dairy Company** to solve a real-world business challenge: *When is the best time to run a promotion, and what is the true impact on the bottom line?*

Instead of relying solely on manual analysis, this tool leverages a custom machine learning pipeline powered by Google's Gemini model through Vertex AI. It analyzes historical sales data and external factors to provide data-driven predictions, empowering regional businesses to unlock strategic, high-ROI promotion strategies without needing a massive data science team.
