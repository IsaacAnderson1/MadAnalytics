    Use preliminary_outputs.json to determine broad, average-level impact weights.

    Use conditional_outputs.json to extract more context-sensitive insights, e.g., how certain weeks or brands deviate from the baseline.

    You may average, smooth, or adjust weights logically based on data distribution, deviation, and recurrence.

    Ensure weights are statistically reasonable, meaning:

        Outliers should not dominate

        The hierarchy should reflect how different conditions influence each factor

    The final output should represent a generalized yet interpretable view of what affects Crystal Farms‚Äô Units Sold and Revenue.

prediction_prompt = """
You are an advanced data analysis model (Gemini). Your goal is to learn how a feature toggle (on/off) and a price decrease affect the units sold and revenue for the product 'Crystal Farm.' You will perform both direct analysis of these variables and incorporate conditional factors (week, month, competitors‚Äô promotions/price decrease) via random sampling and multiple-weight aggregation. Finally, you will predict how changes in these variables‚Äîgiven specific input values‚Äîimpact the increase in units sold and revenue for 'Crystal Farm.' 

Here is how you should proceed:

1. **Initial Analysis (Direct Feature/Price Impact)**  
   - Focus only on the relevant columns that reveal whether the feature was on/off, the magnitude of the price decrease, units sold, and revenue for ‚ÄòCrystal Farm.‚Äô  
   - Determine how turning the feature on (vs. off) and how implementing a price decrease (vs. no price decrease) correlate with higher or lower units sold and revenue.  

2. **Conditional Factors (Random Sampling)**  
   - Next, incorporate the conditional variables (week, month, competitor‚Äôs promotions/feature toggles, competitor‚Äôs price decrease magnitudes) by sampling them.  
   - Examine how these external factors alter the effectiveness of turning the feature on/off and implementing a price decrease for 'Crystal Farm.'  

3. **Multiple Weight Sets & Aggregation**  
   - Generate multiple sets of weights or coefficients (an ensemble or bagging approach) when analyzing the effects of (feature_on/off) and (price_decrease) under these varying conditional factors.  
   - Aggregate these weight sets in a reasonable manner (for example, by averaging or applying a weighted average) to ensure robust, consensus-driven estimates of how each variable influences units sold and revenue.  

4. **What-If Prediction**  
   - Given a specific set of values for:  
       - Feature toggle (on/off)  
       - Price decrease magnitude  
       - Week/Month  
       - Competitors‚Äô features on/off  
       - Competitors‚Äô price decrease magnitude  
     ...predict the resulting increase (or decrease) in units sold and revenue for ‚ÄòCrystal Farm.‚Äô  

5. **Final Output**  
   - Return your final predictions in a JSON format that captures the estimated effect on both units sold and revenue.  

Now, please learn these patterns from the data provided and perform the requested what-if analysis.
